# Key Learnings from the Module

## 1. Core C++ Concepts:
- **Namespaces** for organizing code.
- **Classes and encapsulation** for structured programming.
- **Static and const members** for shared and immutable data.
- **Initialization lists** for efficient object construction.
- **Streams and I/O formatting** for user-friendly output.

## 2. Practical Applications:
- **Exercise 00 (BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ):**
  - Zombie class, stack vs. heap allocation, and debugging with destructors.
- **Exercise 01 (Moar brainz!):**
  - Creating and managing zombie hordes with memory management.
- **Exercise 02 (HI THIS IS BRAIN):**
  - Pointers vs. references and memory address handling.
- **Exercise 03 (Unnecessary violence):**
  - Weapon and Human classes with dynamic weapon type changes.
- **Exercise 04 (Sed is for losers):**
  - String manipulation and file I/O for replacing occurrences in files.
- **Exercise 05 (Harl 2.0):**
  - Automating complaints using member function pointers.
- **Exercise 06 (Harl filter):**
  - Filtering complaints using switch statements.

## 3. Best Practices:
- Encapsulation for controlled data access.
- Reusability through modular design.
- Proper memory management to avoid leaks.

## Takeaway:
This module provides a strong foundation in C++ by covering memory management, class design, pointers, references, and practical applications of core concepts.
