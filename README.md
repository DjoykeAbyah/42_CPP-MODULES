# C++ Modules Overview and Purpose

The C++ modules helped me learn advanced programming concepts through practical exercises. Each module built on the previous one and introduced new techniques and tips for writing better C++ programs. 

1. **Mastering C++ Core Concepts**: From basic syntax and object-oriented programming to advanced features like templates, STL, and polymorphism.
2. **Developing Problem-Solving Skills**: Tackling problems with efficient algorithms and robust code design.
3. **Promoting Best Practices**: Emphasizing memory safety, code reusability, performance optimization, and error handling.
4. **Hands-On Learning**: Reinforcing theoretical knowledge through practical exercises.
