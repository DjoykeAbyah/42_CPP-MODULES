# Key Learnings from the Module

## 1. **Core C++ Concepts:**
- **Namespaces** for organizing code.
- **Classes and encapsulation** for structured programming.
- **Static and const members** for shared and immutable data.
- **Initialization lists** for efficient object construction.
- **Streams and I/O formatting** for user-friendly output.

## 2. **Practical Applications:**
- **Exercise 00 (Megaphone):**
  - Command-line argument handling, string manipulation, and uppercase conversion.
- **Exercise 01 (PhoneBook):**
  - Class-based design, data storage with arrays, user input validation, and formatted table display.
- **Exercise 02 (Recreating Account.cpp):**
  - Debugging, reading logs, and implementing missing functionality based on tests and headers.

## 3. **Best Practices:**
- Encapsulation for controlled data access.
- Reusability through modular design.
- User-friendly, formatted output using `iomanip`.

## **Takeaway:**
The module builds a solid foundation in C++ by teaching structured programming, class design, and debugging techniques, preparing for more advanced topics.
