# Key Learnings from the Module

## 1. Core C++ Concepts:
- **Orthodox Canonical Form** for consistent and maintainable class structures.
- **Fixed-point arithmetic** for balanced performance and precision.
- **Operator overloading** for intuitive arithmetic, comparison, and I/O operations.
- **Static member functions** for utility operations on class instances.
- **Ad-hoc polymorphism** for flexible function behavior.

## 2. Practical Applications:
- **Exercise 00 (My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form):**
  - Implementing a fixed-point number class with getters, setters, and basic operations.
  - Understanding constructors, destructors, and copy mechanisms.
- **Exercise 01 (Towards a more useful fixed-point number class):**
  - Adding constructors for integers and floats.
  - Converting fixed-point values to integers and floats.
  - Overloading `<<` for floating-point output.
- **Exercise 02 (Now weâ€™re talking):**
  - Overloading arithmetic, comparison, and increment/decrement operators.
  - Adding static min/max functions for comparisons between instances.
- **Exercise 03 (BSP - Binary Space Partitioning):**
  - Implementing a `Point` class to represent 2D points in Orthodox Canonical Form.
  - Writing a `bsp` function to determine if a point lies inside a triangle using fixed-point arithmetic.

## 3. Best Practices:
- Ensure memory safety by implementing proper destructors and avoiding memory leaks.
- Test all edge cases, especially in mathematical and geometric computations.
- Use operator overloading and static methods for intuitive class interactions.

## Takeaway:
This module deepens understanding of C++ by introducing fixed-point arithmetic, operator overloading, and canonical class structure. It emphasizes mathematical precision, efficient memory management, and extensible design principles for advanced programming challenges.
